            <p>
                My name is Luis Ramirez; I'm passionate about social justice, fighting for equality, and<br> changing the narrative society places on people of color through my designs. I strive<br> to learn new things every day and love meeting people
                who are the same. I also love<br> to play video games and enjoy sharing my ideas with the world.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm a self-taught web developer/designer. I learned the processes, concepts, and<br> theories of UX/UI and web development through attending workshops, online classes,<br> reading blogs and applying these to projects in my spare time.
                I am very much a<br> big-picture thinker and enjoy working on projects from ideation to development.

                <h3>03-01-2023</h3>
                <p>Design inspiration is a crucial part of the design process. It helps designers to generate fresh and innovative ideas and to stay up-to-date with the latest trends and styles. However, finding the right design inspiration can be a daunting task, especially with the number of websites available on the internet. In this article, I will be exploring the best websites for design inspiration. I have curated a list of websites that are guaranteed to provide designers with an endless supply of inspiration, no matter the type of project they are working on. These websites have helped me through the years as a designer. I included a few random websites because I enjoy getting inspiration from all venues. 
                    Whether you are a seasoned designer or just starting, this article is a must-read for anyone looking to find inspiration for their next design project. So, let's dive in and explore the best websites for design inspiration! </p>
                <p>That is why I decided to write this article to help those that are new to animations. I would have loved for there to be something like this when I first started my development journey. So I decided to write a short list of the best tools to get you started. This will be a list of the best tools for any developer or designer that wants to add a bit of flair to their site. Yet, if you are not a developer/designer you can still read along. Most of these tools are helpful for anyone with a business. Having a basic knowledge of JavaScript will be helpful. Most of the tools use javascript animations.JavaScript animations are dynamic effects and movements created on a web page using JavaScript code. They animate HTML elements, create smooth transitions, and add interactivity to a website. With all the technical stuff and intro out of the way here is the list of my favorites tools.</p>
                <h4>Savee</h4>
                <p>Savee is a platform for you to find some of the world’s best visual inspiration & save images you love. They have no ads and don’t track you. I personally use <span><a href="https://savee.it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Savee</a></span> all the time because of the quality of the images. If you are like me and love bringing artistry to your design. Savee is perfect for your mood board. You can browse a collection of images curated by the best. Save pictures straight from the web, Instagram, or your library. I love the collection of images they have and how they allow me to find inspiration in places I would normally never look. Which allows me to create unique designs that are unique for my clients.</p>
                <h4>Behance</h4>
                <p>Behance is another popular website that provides designers with a platform to showcase their work. It features a vast collection of design projects, ranging from graphic design to motion graphics and UI/UX design. Designers can also search for projects by color, style, and other criteria. The one thing I do not like about <span><a href="https://www.behance.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Behance</a></span> is that it clutters your mind with other websites. This can lead to you copying designs you liked subconsciously.</p>
                <h4>Awwwards</h4>
                <p>Awwwards is a website that recognizes and awards the best web design projects. It features a collection of visually stunning and innovative website designs that can inspire designers to push the boundaries of their creativity. I love going to <span><a href="https://www.awwwards.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Awwwards</a></span> to keep up with the latest trends in web development. I also enjoy searching for animations on there and trying to recreate them myself.</p>
                <h4>Pinterest</h4>
                <p><span><a href="https://www.pinterest.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pinterest</a></span> is a visual discovery and bookmarking platform that has become a popular source of design inspiration. It features a vast collection of user-generated content, including photographs, illustrations, and design projects. Pinterest is great for any type of design you are working on. You can find inspirations for posters, labels, websites, and more there. Pinterest has a great interface also that makes it easy to create separate mood boards.</p>
                <h4>Typographicposters</h4>
                <p>Typographicposters is a website that showcases a collection of typographic posters created by various designers from around the world. The posters feature a wide range of typography styles and designs, including hand-drawn lettering, bold sans-serif fonts, and decorative serifs. The website's interface is simple and easy to navigate, allowing users to browse through the posters by style, designer, and category. <span><a href="https://www.typographicposters.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Typographicposters</a></span> is a great source of inspiration for anyone interested in typography and design.</p>
                <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                <p>Finding design inspiration is essential for designers to keep their creativity and skills up-to-date. The websites I listed in this article offer a wealth of design resources, inspiration, and tools for designers to create unique and visually stunning projects. Whether you are a seasoned designer or just starting, exploring these websites can help you stay up-to-date with the latest design trends and styles, and enhance your creativity and skills. From showcasing your work to discovering new talent, these websites provide a platform for designers to connect and collaborate. In conclusion, I hope this article has been helpful in providing you with an overview of the best websites for design inspiration. By exploring these websites and incorporating their ideas and resources into your designs, you can create unique and visually stunning projects that will stand out from the rest. Remember, design is an ever-evolving field, so don't be afraid to experiment and push the boundaries of your creativity. One thing I want you to keep in mind when looking for design inspiration is to try to be original, don’t copy someone else’s design. If you like elements of their design try to recreate them in your own way.

                <h3>01-31-2023</h3>
                <p>Yesterday was a day like no other. While scrolling through <span><a href="https://www.awwwards.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">awwwards</a></span> I thought about how far web design has come.  Creating modern, interactive frontends has become so much easier. I remember the days when tools like <span><a href="https://greensock.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GSAP</a></span> did not exist. It use to be a pain to make everything from scratch. So most websites didn't use animations and if they did they were simple ones. Now you see crazy websites that take advantage of the new tools and create sites that are all in 3D. A great example of this is <span><a href="https://www.engine.land/it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">engines</a></span> website. Their website showcases how far you can take your idea.</p>
                <p>That is why I decided to write this article to help those that are new to animations. I would have loved for there to be something like this when I first started my development journey. So I decided to write a short list of the best tools to get you started. This will be a list of the best tools for any developer or designer that wants to add a bit of flair to their site. Yet, if you are not a developer/designer you can still read along. Most of these tools are helpful for anyone with a business. Having a basic knowledge of JavaScript will be helpful. Most of the tools use javascript animations.JavaScript animations are dynamic effects and movements created on a web page using JavaScript code. They animate HTML elements, create smooth transitions, and add interactivity to a website. With all the technical stuff and intro out of the way here is the list of my favorites tools.</p>
                <h4>GSAP</h4>
                <p>My personal favorite when creating a vanilla js website is <span><a href="https://greensock.com/gsap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GSAP.</a></span> GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) is a JavaScript library for creating high-performance animations. It provides a suite of tools for animating HTML and SVG elements, including tweening and timeline animation. GSAP is widely used in web development for creating complex and smooth animations and is known for its reliability, speed, and ease of use. It works across all modern browsers and supports a wide range of features and plugins, making it a popular choice for developers looking to add dynamic animations to their web projects.</p>
                <h4>Framer Motion</h4>
                <p>If you are working with a react library then you should be using <span><a href="https://www.framer.com/motion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">framer motion</a></span>. Framer Motion is a React-based animation library for creating animations and interactions for web applications. It provides a simple, declarative API for creating animations and transitions, making it easy for developers to add dynamic effects to their applications.

It is designed to be performant and flexible, allowing developers to create complex animations with ease. It is also highly customizable, making it a popular choice for web developers looking to add dynamic and engaging animations to their applications.</p>
                <h4>Rive</h4>
                <p>Rive is also a great library to use. <span><a href="https://rive.app" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rive</a></span> is new to the scene but has made waves in the design community in recent months. Rive is a vector-based animation platform for creating interactive animations and animations for games, apps, and the web. It provides a visual authoring environment that allows designers and developers to create animations using a library of customizable components, without the need for code. Rive animations can be exported as code or as a runtime library, making it easy to integrate animations into a variety of platforms and environments. It supports a wide range of features, including physics-based animations, particle effects, and dynamic animations, and is designed to be fast and efficient, making it a popular choice for creating engaging and interactive animations.</p>
                <h4>Three JS</h4>
                <p><span><a href="https://threejs.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Three.js</a></span> is a JavaScript library for creating 3D graphics and animations for the web. It provides an easy-to-use API for creating and manipulating 3D objects, scenes, and animations, and is built on top of WebGL, a low-level graphics API for the web. Three.js makes it possible to create complex and interactive 3D graphics without the need for plugins and is widely used in web development for creating 3D visualizations, games, and animations.

Three.js is an open-source library, making it freely available for developers to use and contribute to.</p>
                <h4>Lottie</h4>
                <p>Lottie is a file format and a library for rendering animations on the web and mobile devices. <span><a href="https://lottiefiles.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lottie</a></span> was created by Airbnb Design and is based on the open-source animation software, Bodymovin. Lottie files are lightweight vector animations that can be easily exported from design tools such as Adobe After Effects and imported into web and mobile applications. The animations are rendered using the Lottie library, which supports a wide range of platforms, including iOS, Android, and the web. The Lottie format is designed to be fast, scalable, and flexible, making it a popular choice for creating engaging animations and effects for web and mobile applications. The use of vector graphics also ensures that the animations remain sharp and clear at any resolution.</p>
                <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                <p>So there you have a list of the best tools out there to add interactivity to your website. I try to post new articles weekly on development and design.
