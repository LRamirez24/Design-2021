            <p>
                My name is Luis Ramirez; I'm passionate about social justice, fighting for equality, and<br> changing the narrative society places on people of color through my designs. I strive<br> to learn new things every day and love meeting people
                who are the same. I also love<br> to play video games and enjoy sharing my ideas with the world.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm a self-taught web developer/designer. I learned the processes, concepts, and<br> theories of UX/UI and web development through attending workshops, online classes,<br> reading blogs and applying these to projects in my spare time.
                I am very much a<br> big-picture thinker and enjoy working on projects from ideation to development.

                <h3>01-31-2023</h3>
                <p>Yesterday was a day like no other. While scrolling through <span><a href="https://www.awwwards.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">awwwards</a></span> I thought about how far web design has come.  Creating modern, interactive frontends has become so much easier. I remember the days when tools like <span><a href="https://greensock.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GSAP</a></span> did not exist. It use to be a pain to make everything from scratch. So most websites didn't use animations and if they did they were simple ones. Now you see crazy websites that take advantage of the new tools and create sites that are all in 3D. A great example of this is <span><a href="https://www.engine.land/it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">engines</a></span> website. Their website showcases how far you can take your idea.</p>
                <p>That is why I decided to write this article to help those that are new to animations. I would have loved for there to be something like this when I first started my development journey. So I decided to write a short list of the best tools to get you started. This will be a list of the best tools for any developer or designer that wants to add a bit of flair to their site. Yet, if you are not a developer/designer you can still read along. Most of these tools are helpful for anyone with a business. Having a basic knowledge of JavaScript will be helpful. Most of the tools use javascript animations.JavaScript animations are dynamic effects and movements created on a web page using JavaScript code. They animate HTML elements, create smooth transitions, and add interactivity to a website. With all the technical stuff and intro out of the way here is the list of my favorites tools.</p>
                <h4>GSAP</h4>
                <p>My personal favorite when creating a vanilla js website is <span><a href="https://greensock.com/gsap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GSAP.</a></span> GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) is a JavaScript library for creating high-performance animations. It provides a suite of tools for animating HTML and SVG elements, including tweening and timeline animation. GSAP is widely used in web development for creating complex and smooth animations and is known for its reliability, speed, and ease of use. It works across all modern browsers and supports a wide range of features and plugins, making it a popular choice for developers looking to add dynamic animations to their web projects.</p>
                <h4>Framer Motion</h4>
                <p>If you are working with a react library then you should be using <span><a href="https://www.framer.com/motion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">framer motion</a></span>. Framer Motion is a React-based animation library for creating animations and interactions for web applications. It provides a simple, declarative API for creating animations and transitions, making it easy for developers to add dynamic effects to their applications. Framer Motion is built on top of the animation library, GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform), and uses the React framework to provide seamless integration with other React components. It is designed to be performant and flexible, allowing developers to create complex animations with ease. It is also highly customizable, making it a popular choice for web developers looking to add dynamic and engaging animations to their applications.</p>
                <h4>Rive</h4>
                <p>Rive is also a great library to use. <span><a href="https://rive.app" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rive</a></span> is new to the scene but has made waves in the design community in recent months. Rive is a vector-based animation platform for creating interactive animations and animations for games, apps, and the web. It provides a visual authoring environment that allows designers and developers to create animations using a library of customizable components, without the need for code. Rive animations can be exported as code or as a runtime library, making it easy to integrate animations into a variety of platforms and environments. It supports a wide range of features, including physics-based animations, particle effects, and dynamic animations, and is designed to be fast and efficient, making it a popular choice for creating engaging and interactive animations.</p>
                <h4>Three JS</h4>
                <p><span><a href="https://threejs.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Three.js</a></span> is a JavaScript library for creating 3D graphics and animations for the web. It provides an easy-to-use API for creating and manipulating 3D objects, scenes, and animations, and is built on top of WebGL, a low-level graphics API for the web. Three.js makes it possible to create complex and interactive 3D graphics without the need for plugins and is widely used in web development for creating 3D visualizations, games, and animations. It supports a wide range of features, including lighting, materials, camera controls, and advanced geometry, and can be easily integrated into other web technologies, such as React and Vue.js. Three.js is an open-source library, making it freely available for developers to use and contribute to.</p>
                <h4>Lottie</h4>
                <p>Lottie is a file format and a library for rendering animations on the web and mobile devices. <span><a href="https://lottiefiles.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lottie</a></span> was created by Airbnb Design and is based on the open-source animation software, Bodymovin. Lottie files are lightweight vector animations that can be easily exported from design tools such as Adobe After Effects and imported into web and mobile applications. The animations are rendered using the Lottie library, which supports a wide range of platforms, including iOS, Android, and the web. The Lottie format is designed to be fast, scalable, and flexible, making it a popular choice for creating engaging animations and effects for web and mobile applications. The use of vector graphics also ensures that the animations remain sharp and clear at any resolution.</p>
                <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                <p>So there you have a list of the best tools out there to add interactivity to your website. I try to post new articles weekly on development and design. So If you want to see more articles like this subscribe to my email and let me know the topic you want me to discuss. Till next time, lets ride!!</p>
